A sketch may serve a number of purposes: it can be used to record something that the artist sees, develop an idea for later use or as a quick way of graphically demonstrating an image, idea or principal. Adobe After Effects is a digital motion graphics and compositing software published by Adobe Systems, used in the post-production process of filmmaking and television production. Storyboards are graphic organizers in the form of illustrations or images displayed in sequence for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture, animation, motion graphic or interactive media sequence. Motion graphics are graphics that use video footage and/or animation technology to create the illusion of motion or rotation, graphics are usually combined with audio for use in multimedia projects. Kinetic typography, the technical name for \"moving text\" is an animation technique mixing motion and text to express ideas using video animation. An illustration is a displayed visualization form presented as a drawing, painting, photograph or other work of art that is created to elucidate or dictate sensual information (such as a story, poem or newspaper article) by providing a visual representation graphically. 2D Animation Types Animation Style 2D Animation Software  Video & Animation 2D animation is creating moving characters, storyboards, and backgrounds in two-dimensional environments.
